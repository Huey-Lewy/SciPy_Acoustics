# SciPy Acoustics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing reverberation times (RT60) in audio recordings to improve voice intelligibility in enclosed spaces.

## Features
- Import and clean audio files (WAV, MP3).
- Visualize audio waveforms and RT60 values for different frequency ranges.
- Generate reports with statistics and visualizations.
